                <h3>A coexisting existence</h3>
                <br>
                <p>It's really easy to find out who your temporal relatives are. They are everywhere. They're all of
                    the 7 billion people of this earth, but on one condition: they <em>have</em> to have been alive at the time that <em>you</em>
                    were alive. A temporal relative is anyone whom you can or ever could interact with, or 
                    in other words, <b>coexist</b> with in the same universe. For instance, if you were born in the 21<small>st</small> century, it is very unlikely that
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein" target="_blank">Albert Einstein</a> is and will ever be your temporal relative, since you both never coexisted at the same time. But an old grandpa born in the 
                    1940's can call Einstein his temporal relative, since both beings once coexisted in the same world.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p style="text-indent: 5%; text-align: justify; color: white;">
                    Less than 10% of all of the humans will ever be your temporal relatives. That's just to show how many of us ever lived, which is estimated
                    to be around 100 billion. The percentage of people that are temporal relatives to each other has been increasing exponentially, considering
                    the populational <em>boom</em> in the last century.
